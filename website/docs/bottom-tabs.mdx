Bottom tabs refferes to a row of links, displayed at the bottom of the screen, and is reffered to as "Tab Bar" in iOS and as "Bottom Navigation Bars" on Android. Usually these are intended to be used to switch between top-level content views with a single tap.

## Creating bottom tabs

  - explain basic setup for bottom tabs

  - maybe talk about styling?

## Selecting Tabs Programmatically
Tabs can be selected programmatically by updating the `currentTabIndex` or `currentTabId` options.

We'll use the following BottomTabs layout to demonstrate programmatic tab selection.

```js
bottomTabs: {
  id: 'BOTTOM_TABS_LAYOUT',
  children: [
    {
      stack: {
        id: 'HOME_TAB',
        children: [
          {
            component: {
              id: 'HOME_SCREEN'
              name: 'HomeScreen'
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    stack: {
      id: 'PROFILE_TAB',
      children: [
        {
          component: {
            id: 'PROFILE_SCREEN',
            name: 'ProfileScreen'
          }
        },
        {
          component: {
            id: 'SETTINGS_SCREEN',
            name: 'SettingsScreen'
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Selecting a tab by index
The following mergeOptions command will select the second tab. We're passing the id of our BottomTabs layout, but we could also use the id of any of the child components, for example `PROFILE_TAB` or `PROFILE_SCREEN`.

```js
Navigation.mergeOptions('BOTTOM_TABS_LAYOUT', {
  bottomTabs: {
    currentTabIndex: 1
  }
});
```

### Selecting a tab by id
Tabs can also be selected by id (`componentId`). This is particularly useful in cases where you don't know in which tab a screen is contained.
For example, if invoked from one of the child components, `HOME_SCREEN` or `SETTINGS_SCREEN`, the following merge command will select the tab containing the child.

```js
Navigation.mergeOptions(this.props.componentId, {
  bottomTabs: {
    currentTabId: this.props.componentId
  }
});
```

## Changing BottomTabs visibility

The `visible` property is used to control the BottomTab visibility. Visibility can be toggled dynamically using the `mergeOptions` command.
```js
Navigation.mergeOptions(componentId, {
  bottomTabs: {
    visible: false
  },
});
```

Visibility can also be changed when pushing screens.
```js
Navigation.push(componentId, {
  component: {
    name: 'pushedScreen',
    options: {
      bottomTabs: {
        visible: false
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Updating tab options dynamically

To update a tab option, like an icon, text or color, simply call `mergeOptions` with new options using the id of a component or layout contained in the tab you wish to update.

For instance, in the example below we update the color of a specific tab:
```js
Navigation.mergeOptions(componentId, {
  bottomTab: {
    iconColor: 'red',
    textColor: 'red'
  },
});
```
