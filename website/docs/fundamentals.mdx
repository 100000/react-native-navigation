## Navigating the app

**TODO**

https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/navigating.html
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation

## Screen Lifecycle

Any React Component registered with react-native-navigation is enhanced with two additional lifecycle events:

* `componentDidAppear` - called each time the component is visible to the user
* `componentDidDisappear` - called each time the component is not visible to the user **as a result of being detached from heirarchy**

These methds compliment React's liefcycle methods:

* `componentDidMount` - called once, when the component is attached to heirarchy **for the first time**
* `componentWillUnmount` - called once, when the component is destroyed

### Mounting
These methods are called in the following order when a component is created and attached to hierarchy.

* constructor()
* render()
* componentDidMount()
* componentDidAppear()

### Unmounting
These methods are called when a component is being removed from hierarchy

* componentDidDisappear()
* componentWillUnmount()

### Modal
When a modal is displayed, depending on the [modalPresentationStyle](), the content behind it might be detached from hierarchy.
This affects the visibility events which are emitted to the content behind the modal.

When Modals with `pageSheet` or `overCurrentContext` modalPresentationStyle are displayed, the previous content is
still visible to the user. Thus `componentDidDisappear` event is **not** emitted.

The same is applied for when a modal is dismissed. If it was presented with `pageSheet` or `overCurrentContext` modalPresentationStyle,
when that modal is dismissed the previous context won't recieve a `componentDidAppear` event.

### Overlay
These methods are called in the following order when a component is displayed as an Overlay.

* constructor()
* render()
* componentDidMount()
* componentDidAppear()

:::note
Content displayed behind an Overlay does not recieve the `componentDidDisappear` since it's still visible to the user and attached to the hierarchy.

## Passing data to components

### Initial props

React components use [props](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/props) to recieve data when they are
created. When displaying [component]() layout, you can pass initial props to the component with the `passProps`
property.

In this example, we push a screen, the `UserProfile` screen, and pass two initial props to it:

```js
Navigation.push(this.props.componentId, {
  component: {
    name: 'UserProfile',
    id: 'PROFILE_SCREEEN_ID'
    passProps: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      status: 'online'
    }
  }
});
```

:::tip Serialization
passProps don't need to be serializable. You can use this mechanism to pass lambda functions or even React Components.

### Updating props

To update a component's props, use the [Navigation.updateProps()]() command. Updating props triggers
the component lifecycle methods related to [updating](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#updating).

Notice that we're using the component's id in order to update props of this specific instance of the component.

```js
Navigation.updateProps('PROFILE_SCREEEN_ID', {
  status: 'offline'
});
```
