## Styling the back button
The back button's style can be customised by declaring a backButton options object. This configuration can be part of a screen's static options, or default options.

```js
backButton: {
  color: 'red',
  icon: require('../../img/customChevron.png')
}
```

## Controling visibility
The back buttons visbility can be controlled with the visible property.

```js
backButton: {
  visible: false
}
```

## Changing visbility programmatically
Back button visibility can be changed dynamically using the mergeOptions command. When using a screen's componentId, the change will affect only that specific screen. But when using the stack's id, the change will affect all screens pushed into the stack.

```js
Navigation.mergeOptions(this.props.componentId, {
  backButton: {
    visible: false
  }
});
```
