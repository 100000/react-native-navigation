In human-centered design generaly, when we speak about a modal (or modality), we often refer to a set of techniques, aimed at bringing user attention to a specific event / screen / action / etc. which often require user input. A pop-up on a website, a file deletion confirmation dialogue on a Mac, or an alert asking you to enable location service on your phone - these can all be considered modals.

Modal is a term used in native iOS world ([full description here](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/modality/)), while on Android, [dialogs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs) are often used to create similar or identical behaviour, alongside other techniques.

## Presenting modals

Modal can be created by doing XXX, as shown in the example below (ADD EXAMPLE):

TODO

- add code snippet showing how to setp up and call a modal (via event or button).
- add a screenshot of how a simple modal looks like when rendered by a RNN-powered app


## Adding a dismiss button
Modals should always have a dismiss button, on left-to-right devices it's typically placed as a left button in the TopBar.
After we've added our dismiss button, we need to dismiss the modal when the button is pressed.

:::note
For the LeftButton to be visible, the screen must be displayed in a Stack.
:::

```js
class ModalScreen extends React.Component {
  // Set a dismiss button in static options
  static options() {
    return {
      topBar: {
        leftButtons: {
          id: 'dismiss',
          icon: require('./dismiss.png')
        }
      }
    };
  }

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Register to events
    Navigation.events().bindComponent(this);
  }

  // Handle the button press event and dismiss the modal if needed
  navigationButtonPressed({ buttonId }) {
    if (buttonId === 'dismiss') {
      Navigation.dismissModal(this.props.componentId);
    }
  }
}
```

## Transparent modals
Showing transparent modals is a nice technique to increase immersiveness while keeping the user in the same context.
When a modal is displayed the content behind it (either root or modal) is removed from heirarchy. While this behavior improves performance, it's undesired when
showing transparent modals as we need to see the content behind it.

To configure this behaviour, we'll need to change the `modalPresentationStyle` option to `overCurrentContext` and change the layout background color to `'transparent'`.

```js
{
  modalPresentationStyle: 'overCurrentContext',
  layout: {
    backgroundColor: 'transparent'
  }
}
```

## Preventing a Modal from being dismissed
Preventing a modal from being dismissed is done differently for each platform. While preventing the user from dismissing the modal is possible,
the modal could still be dismissed programmatically by calling `Navigation.dismissModal()`

If the modal has a dismiss button, of course you'll need to handle it your self and avoid calling `Navigation.dismissModal()`
when the button is pressed.

### Android
On Android, modals can be dismissed with the hardware back button. You can handle the back press your self by
adding a [BackHandler](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/backhandler)

### iOS
While iOS devices don't have a hardware back button, PageSheet modals can be dismissed by swipe gesture
from the top of the screen. To disable it, set [swipeToDismiss]() option to false.
