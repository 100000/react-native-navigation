## Adding a dismiss button
Modals should always have a dismiss button, on left-to-right devices it's typically placed as a left button in the TopBar.
After we've added our dismiss button, we need to dismiss the modal when the button is pressed.

:::note
For the LeftButton to be visible, the screen must be displayed in a Stack.
:::

```js
class ModalScreen extends React.Component {
  // Set a dismiss button in static options
  static options() {
    return {
      topBar: {
        leftButtons: {
          id: 'dismiss',
          icon: require('./dismiss.png')
        }
      }
    };
  }

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Register to events
    Navigation.events().bindComponent(this);
  }

  // Handle the button press event and dismiss the modal if needed
  navigationButtonPressed({ buttonId }) {
    if (buttonId === 'dismiss') {
      Navigation.dismissModal(this.props.componentId);
    }
  }
}
```

## Transparent modals
Showing transparent modals is a nice technique to increase immersiveness while keeping the user in the same context.
When a modal is displayed the content behind it (either root or modal) is removed from heirarchy. While this behavior improves performance, it's undesired when
showing transparent modals as we need to see the content behind it.

To configure this behaviour, we'll need to change the `modalPresentationStyle` option to `overCurrentContext` and change the layout background color to `'transparent'`.

```js
{
  modalPresentationStyle: 'overCurrentContext',
  layout: {
    backgroundColor: 'transparent'
  }
}
```
