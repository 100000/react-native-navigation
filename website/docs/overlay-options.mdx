Controls overlay options

```js
const options = {
  overlay: {

  }
}
```

### `interceptTouchOutside`
This option controls wether touch events outside the bounds of the overlay, will be handles by the content behind the overlay. When set to true, touch events will **not** pass through to the underlying content.

| Type  | Required | Platform |
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| boolean | No       | Both     |

### `handleKeyboardEvents`
Overlays on iOS don't handle keyboard events by default. If your Overlay contains a TextInput component, you'll want to enable this option so the TextInput responds to keyboard events.
